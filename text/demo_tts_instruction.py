The first is to read out the displayed German sentence while we are recording. The second task is to keep seated and relaxed while either opening or closing your eyes. In the third task, you will hear a German sentence with a missing word, and you will be expected to fill in the blank by speaking out your answer. Now, we will start a practice block to make you more familiar with these tasks. Please feel free to ask the experimenter any questions you might have during the practice block.</speak>"
